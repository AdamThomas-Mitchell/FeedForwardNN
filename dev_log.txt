Wrote a function to download the MNIST raw data. Next step is to write a function to process it so it is ready for model ingestion.

To do:
* Noticed python logging isn't working - should look into that 
* write code to process raw MNIST data

Rewrote the code for downloading raw MNIST data so it was more modular. Spent sometime looking into processing the raw data. Have a pretty good idea how to do this now. 
I should save the processed data as a numpy file so it can be quickly and easily read in by the model.
