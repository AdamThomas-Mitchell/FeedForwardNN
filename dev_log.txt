Wrote a function to download the MNIST raw data. Next step is to write a function to process it so it is ready for model ingestion.

To do:
* Noticed python logging isn't working - should look into that 
* write code to process raw MNIST data

# 11/11/24
Rewrote the code for downloading raw MNIST data so it was more modular. Spent sometime looking into processing the raw data. Have a pretty good idea how to do this now. 
I should save the processed data as a numpy file so it can be quickly and easily read in by the model.

Wrote functions to process the raw MNIST data and save it as npy file in the required format.
This should make it easy to just load in the data when training the model or testing performance.
Currently writing this such that the process can be seen as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
Might want to look into CMake for running the individual processes. 

To do:
* fix python logging - still haven't done this 
* Verify processed data is actually correct - more generally, unit tests??
* start developing model - architecture and forward pass will be the first step
